<h2>ANUBIS NEW MAP</h2>
<h2>26.01.2023</h2>
<p class="info">Today’s update includes an adjustment to the Active Duty map pool as well as some weapon adjustments.</p>
<img src="https://cdn1.dotesports.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/18152134/csgo-anubis.jpg" width="500">
<p class="info">For starters, we’re making changes to the Active Duty map pool, which will determine which maps get played at the 2023 Paris Major.<br>

  <strong>Anubis</strong> is being added to Active <strong>Duty and Dust II</strong> is being removed. But both maps are still available in <em></em>Casual, Deathmatch, and Competitive modes.</em><br>

  We’re also making some adjustments to weapons. The AWP has had its magazine size reduced to five bullets (so make them count!), and the M4A1-S now does less damage at long ranges.<br>

  Try the changes out and let us know what you think!</p>


<h2>IEM RIO MAJOR CHAMPIONS</h2>
<img src = "https://cdn.akamai.steamstatic.com/apps/csgo/images/blog/steam_cover_champions_en.jpg" width="500">
<p class="info">Over the past two weeks Rio de Janeiro has been the center of Counter-Strike, where 24 of the best teams in the world fought to become IEM Rio Major champions.<br>
  In the end, only one team was left standing as Outsiders bested Heroic on Mirage and Overpass to secure their first Major championship!<br>

  To celebrate our new champions, today we’re releasing the champions autograph capsule, featuring autographs from FL1T, fame, Jame, n0rb3r7, and Qikert in paper, glitter, holo, and gold.</p>
